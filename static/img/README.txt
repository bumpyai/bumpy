# Image Assets

This directory should contain the following image assets:

1. hero-image.jpg - A high-quality image showing a chatbot or AI assistant interface
   - Recommended size: 1200x800 pixels
   - This is used on the homepage

If these images are missing, the application will fall back to placeholder images.

You can replace these with your own branded images while maintaining the same filenames.
